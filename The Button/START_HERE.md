## 🎮 How It Will Work (Once Setup)

1. **Player opens game** → MainMenu loads
2. **Auto sign-in** → Anonymous auth (automatic)
3. **Create lobby** → Gets 6-digit code from Unity
4. **Friends join** → Enter code to join
5. **In lobby room** → See all players, chat ready
6. **Host starts** → All load into GameRoom scene
7. **Players spawn** → First-person view, can move
8. **Stats active** → Hunger/thirst decay, need items
9. **Items spawn** → Press buttons to get items (Phase 3)
10. **Survive & escape** → Use items wisely (Phase 3)
