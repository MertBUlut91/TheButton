# The Button - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Open Unity Project
- Open Unity Hub
- Add project: `/Users/mertbulut/The Button`
- Unity will import new packages (Lobby, Relay)
- Wait for compilation to complete

### 2. Check Console for Errors
- If you see errors, they're likely just missing references (expected until you create scenes)
- If you see package errors, go to Window > Package Manager and ensure all packages are installed

### 3. Link to Unity Gaming Services
1. Edit > Project Settings > Services
2. Click "Create Unity Project ID" or link existing
3. Sign in with Unity account

### 4. Enable Services on Dashboard
1. Go to https://dashboard.unity.com
2. Select your project
3. Enable **Lobby** service
4. Enable **Relay** service
5. Both are free to use

### 5. Follow Detailed Setup
Open and follow: **MULTIPLAYER_SETUP_GUIDE.md**

- Creating scenes
- Building UI
- Creating prefabs
- Connecting references

- Players have stats (health, hunger, thirst, stamina)
- Buttons on walls spawn items
- Players collect items in inventory
- Players use items to survive and escape

## 📋 Current Status

**Phase 1: ✅ COMPLETE**
- Multiplayer lobby system
- Network infrastructure
- Player movement and stats
- UI framework

**Phase 2: 🚧 IN PROGRESS (You're here!)**
- Unity Editor setup
- Scene creation
- UI implementation
- Prefab creation

**Phase 3: 📅 NEXT**
- Button system
- Item spawning
- Inventory interactions
- Game mechanics

## 🛠️ Tools You'll Use

- **Unity Editor** - Scene and prefab creation
- **Unity Services Dashboard** - Enable Lobby/Relay
- **Unity Multiplayer Play Mode** - Testing (Unity 2023+)
- **Build & Run** - Multi-instance testing

## 📚 Key Files to Reference

1. **MULTIPLAYER_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Full Unity setup instructions
2. **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Technical details
3. **README.md** - Project overview

## ⏱️ Time Estimate

- Unity Services Setup: 5 minutes
- MainMenu Scene Setup: 30-45 minutes
- GameRoom Scene Setup: 20-30 minutes
- Testing: 15 minutes

**Total**: ~1.5-2 hours for complete setup

## 🆘 Common Issues

### "Authentication failed"
- Link project to Unity Services
- Check internet connection
- Sign out/in from Unity Editor

### "Lobby service not available"
- Enable Lobby in Unity Dashboard
- Wait a few minutes for service activation
- Restart Unity Editor

### "Relay allocation failed"
- Enable Relay in Unity Dashboard
- Check Unity Services status page
- Verify project is linked

### "NetworkManager not found"
- Ensure NetworkSetup GameObject exists
- Check NetworkManager component is attached
- Verify scene is saved

### "Player not spawning"
- Add Player prefab to NetworkManager's prefab list
- Check Player has NetworkObject component
- Verify GameRoom scene is in Build Settings

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use Multiplayer Play Mode** (Unity 2023+)
   - Window > Multiplayer Play Mode
   - Test without building

2. **Check Console Logs**
   - Look for `[Auth]`, `[Lobby]`, `[Relay]`, `[Network]` messages
   - They show exactly what's happening

3. **Test Incrementally**
   - Test lobby creation first
   - Then test joining
   - Then test game start
   - Then test player spawning

4. **Save Often**
   - Save scenes: Ctrl/Cmd + S
   - Save project: File > Save Project

5. **Use Prefab Variants**
   - Create UI prefabs for reusability
   - Saves time on duplicate UI elements

## 🎮 Controls (Once In Game)

- **WASD** - Move
- **Mouse** - Look
- **Space** - Jump
- **1-5** - Use inventory items
- **Escape** - Toggle cursor
