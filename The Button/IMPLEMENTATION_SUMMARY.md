## What Still Needs Unity Editor Configuration

The following must be done in Unity Editor (see MULTIPLAYER_SETUP_GUIDE.md):

1. **Unity Services Setup**
   - Link project to UGS
   - Enable Lobby and Relay services

2. **Scene Creation**
   - MainMenu scene with UI
   - GameRoom scene with gameplay area

3. **UI Prefabs**
   - LobbyItem prefab (for lobby list)
   - PlayerItem prefab (for player list)
   - InventorySlot prefab (for inventory UI)

4. **Player Prefab**
   - Player capsule with all components
   - Camera setup
   - Nametag canvas
   - Add to NetworkManager

5. **UI Hierarchy**

## Architecture Notes

### Network Authority
- **Server-Authoritative**: All gameplay logic runs on server/host
- **Client Prediction**: None implemented (can be added for movement)
- **NetworkVariables**: Used for player stats synchronization
- **ServerRpc**: Used for client requests (item usage, stat changes)

### Scene Management
- **MainMenu**: Non-networked, lobby UI only
- **GameRoom**: Networked, gameplay scene
- **NetworkManager**: Persists between scenes (DontDestroyOnLoad)

### Singleton Pattern
All manager scripts use singleton pattern:
- AuthenticationManager.Instance
- LobbyManager.Instance
- RelayManager.Instance
- NetworkManagerSetup.Instance
- ConnectionManager.Instance

### Event System
- LobbyManager: OnLobbyUpdated, OnLobbyLeft
- ConnectionManager: OnConnectionStateChanged, OnConnectionError
- PlayerInventory: OnInventoryChanged

## Testing Recommendations

### Single Instance Testing
1. Create lobby
2. Verify lobby code generation
3. Check console for authentication and lobby creation logs

### Multi-Instance Testing (Build Required)
1. Build game
2. Host instance: Create lobby (note code)
3. Client instance: Join by code
4. Verify both players see each other in lobby
5. Host: Start game
6. Verify scene transition
7. Verify player spawning and movement
8. Verify stats synchronization

### Multiplayer Play Mode (Unity 2023+)
1. Window > Multiplayer Play Mode
2. Enable 2-4 virtual players
3. Test full flow

## Known Limitations

1. **No Host Migration**: If host disconnects, lobby closes
2. **No Reconnection**: Disconnected players cannot rejoin
3. **8 Player Limit**: Unity Relay free tier limitation
4. **Internet Required**: Uses cloud services (Lobby + Relay)
5. **Anonymous Only**: No persistent user accounts yet
6. **No Dedicated Server**: Host acts as server

## Performance Considerations

- Lobby heartbeat: 15s (can be adjusted)
- Lobby polling: 2s (can be adjusted)
- Stats update: Every frame on server (can be throttled)
- Network tick rate: Default Unity Netcode settings

## Credits

All scripts use TheButton namespace for organization:
- TheButton.Network
- TheButton.Player
- TheButton.UI

Unity version: 2022.3+ LTS
Unity Render Pipeline: URP (Universal Render Pipeline)

---

**Status**: Core multiplayer lobby system complete. Ready for Unity Editor configuration and game mechanic implementation.
